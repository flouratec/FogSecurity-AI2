# FogSecurity-AI2  
### AI-Driven Integrated Fog Computing Security Framework

FogSecurity-AI2 is a research-driven security architecture designed to enhance trust, reliability, and service availability in fog computing environments. The framework integrates:

- Lightweight node authentication (ANT)
- Mobility-aware session management (MTP)
- AI-based adaptive trust evaluation

This project demonstrates how intelligent fog-layer mechanisms can protect distributed IoT systems against rogue nodes and service disruption.
