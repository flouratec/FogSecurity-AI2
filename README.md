# FogSecurity-AI2  
### AI-Driven Integrated Fog Computing Security Framework
FogSecurity-AI2 is a research-driven security architecture designed to enhance trust, reliability, and service availability in fog computing environments. The framework integrates:

- Lightweight node authentication (ANT)
- Mobility-aware session management (MTP)
- AI-based adaptive trust evaluation

   ## 🔐 Description
This project implements a hybrid security model combining:
- **Authentication Node Table (ANT):** prevents rogue node attacks using SHA-256 hashing.
- **Mobility Tracker Protocol (MTP):** maintains session continuity during node handoff.
- **Routing Table:** stores session states as JSON objects for rapid recovery.

This project demonstrates how intelligent fog-layer mechanisms can protect distributed IoT systems against rogue nodes and service disruption.

## 📊 Simulation Dataset
Contains latency and reliability tests comparing cloud vs fog processing:
| Metric | Cloud | Fog | Improvement |
|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| Retrieval (100MB) | 2.1s | 0.7s | 66% |
| Handoff latency | 580ms | 150ms | 74% |

The FogSecurity-AI2 system was implemented as a hybrid architecture. The experimental interface was developed using web technologies, while backend fog services were implemented in PHP. AI-driven trust evaluation and performance analytics were developed using Python scripts, forming a multi-layer research prototype.
## 🛠 Technology Stack

FogSecurity-AI2 was developed using a hybrid multi-layered architecture combining web technologies, fog-layer services, and AI-driven analytics.

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|------|------------|------|
| Frontend Simulation | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript | Interactive research dashboard, visualization, performance monitoring, attack simulation |
| Data Visualization | Chart.js | Real-time graphical performance analysis |
| Fog Service Layer | PHP | Node authentication (ANT), session migration (MTP), fog gateway simulation |
| AI & Analytics Layer | Python | Adaptive trust engine, latency analysis, experimental data processing |
| Data Storage (Experimental) | CSV / Local Storage | Research data logging and analysis datasets |

This combination of technologies allows FogSecurity-AI2 to function as a complete research prototype that integrates visualization, fog-layer service control, and AI-based analytical intelligence.
