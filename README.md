# FogSecurity-AI2  
### AI-Driven Integrated Fog Computing Security Framework
FogSecurity-AI2 is a research-driven security architecture designed to enhance trust, reliability, and service availability in fog computing environments. The framework integrates:

- Lightweight node authentication (ANT)
- Mobility-aware session management (MTP)
- AI-based adaptive trust evaluation

   ## 🔐 Description
This project implements a hybrid security model combining:
- **Authentication Node Table (ANT):** prevents rogue node attacks using SHA-256 hashing.
- **Mobility Tracker Protocol (MTP):** maintains session continuity during node handoff.
- **Routing Table:** stores session states as JSON objects for rapid recovery.

This project demonstrates how intelligent fog-layer mechanisms can protect distributed IoT systems against rogue nodes and service disruption.
